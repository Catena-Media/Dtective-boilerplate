# Dtective Boilerplate

## Quickstart

This repository has the boilerplate code necessary to start writing tests as fast as possible.
To get the boilerplate please fork this repository. Check the [docs](https://dtective.io) for more information on
how to get started, installations and necessary configuration.



Keep the boilerplate updated with  **Dtective** latest changes by bumping the version in the `pom.xml`.

```java
<dependency>
    <groupId>catena.qa</groupId>
    <artifactId>TestAutomationEngineAllInOne</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.6</version>
</dependency>
```
